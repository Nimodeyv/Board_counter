How to use Board_counter ?
/---------------------------------------------------------------------------------/
1. Download in your local directory Board_counter/raw_images, the images you want to predict or count
2. Start Board_counter application (see above if not yet done)
3. On the fastAPI page, click on POST
10. Click Try it out
11. You need to enter in the Request Body field the following informations:
	"seuil_de_d√©tection": is the level above which the detection will be counted (between 0 and 1)
	"path": is the path of the image you want to predict (see above, load here the image in the directory you synchronize with Docker)
	The next 4 values below are here, in case you want to restrict the counting a copping part of the image, it is recommended to start with values=0 (default) and then refine if needed to ajust the prediction.
	"crop_horiz_min", "crop_horiz_max", "crop_vert_min", "crop_vert_max"
12. Outcome of the prediction is shown in Server response below:
	It shows a graph with the number of boards "Nombre de planches"
	Each board has a number and a confidence level, that you can find back on the right graph.
	
Limits & bugs of this version:
	- This model was trained on only 2 pictures, and one type of boards, it is therefore very limited, but this was not the intial purpose of this project.
	- On version v6.0 there is an offset between the number of board/box on the pictures and the ones on the graph. Picture board number = Graph box number + 1. It is corrected in version v7.1.
